# Info
- `Node.js` is a JavaScript runtime environment (ie. it lets you run JavaScript code)
- `npm` is used to managed JavaScript packages
- `package.json` contains the project and dependency info
- Webpack is a module bundler for JavaScript applications. It takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules. We will use webpack to bundle multiple JavaScript files into a single file. A module bundler allows you to write modular code and bundle it into a single file.
- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language.

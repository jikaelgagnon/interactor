# Contributing

This project is currently not maintained. That said, I welcome any contributions. Here are a few that were once on the roadmap (from easier to harder):
- Documentation
- A websocket mode to allow interaction streaming (realtime use case)
- Caching of interactions in Localstorage for alter retrieval (networking error resilience)
- A NPM module for a backend covering XHR and WSS modes.
- A streaming interaction metrics and visualizations dashboard

None of these strike your fancy? Feel free to send a pull request and short description of whatever new feature you decide to create.

And thanks!
